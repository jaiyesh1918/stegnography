The rise of cyber threats and data breaches necessitates secure communication methods to protect sensitive information.
Steganography enables covert data transmission by hiding messages within digital media, making it difficult for attackers to detect.
Traditional encryption raises suspicion, whereas steganography ensures secrecy by concealing the existence of the data itself.
This technique is essential for secure messaging, digital watermarking, and protecting confidential communications in critical sectors.
